        <h4><b>Idea</b></h4>
        <p class="paragraphPositioning"> This was all made in 2017. I wanted something to illustrate the importance of encouraging creativity. I don't remember how the conflict of stealing arms came about, but I do know I wanted something unxexpected in the story execution.</p>
        <h4>Characters</h4>
        <h5>Mai</h5>
        <p>I remember wanting the main character of this little short to not be too different from me, so I decided on a little Asian girl who was good at drawing. The overall look of her is a rough combination of how I looked in 2017-2018 and how I looked as a kid.</p>
        <img src="../../static/animation related/Mai & Zen/2018/Mai Emotions and Poses 001.jpg" alt="Mai Designs"/>
        <p>I wanted Mai to be v ery expressive, so I took inspiration from anime with their exagerated expressions</p>

        <h5>Zen</h5>
        <p>Zen was a variation of another character I thought of as a child. Below was his initial design.</p>
        <img src="../../static/animation related/Mai & Zen/2018/zen_by_phantomhive24_dbmlj5o.jpg" alt="old Zen design"/>
        <p>I wanted the look of the story to have more appeal, since I wanted the main story to also appeal to a younger audience. So Zen needed a redesign. The two mouth design lacked personality, and I believe would have been a bit scary for something aimed towards young children. So I gave him bigger roundeer eyes and axed the second mouth. I took inspiration from My Life as Teenage Robot for the look of Zen's eyes.</p>
        <img src="../../static/animation related/Mai & Zen/2018/Zen-emotions-and-poses-002.jpg" alt="Zen new design"/>
        <p>Fleshing out Zen's emotions didn't prove too dificult because I pictured him behaving not too differently from a typical kid.</p>

        <h5>Overall Look</h5>
        <p>I intended the look at the time to be very simple, so I took heavy inspiration from a flash animation I watched when I was younger, Making Fiends (2008-2023). I really liked the simplicty in how the characters looked with the main characters getting a designated main color. So I chose that look for Mai and Zen.</p>

        <p>To emphasize the kid like nature in both, I wanted Mai and Zen to be quite small.</p>

        <p>This is a story I would like to revisit one day.</p>
